In general
----------

This package contains HP-48 and HP-50 programs to convert
Gregorian dates to French Revolutionary dates and in the other
direction. It includes also a reform which was never put in effect,
the decimalisation of time.

Installation procedure: not yet ready.

Unlike the package from hpcalc.org, you have only the base files,
from which the others are generated. The tool to generate 
the derived files can be found in another Git Hub repository.

Note: this tool is still in development. Be sure to check
the last version.

For the moment, you can generate the HTML files and copy
(by hand) the code into your HP computer. Since this file
was derived from an older French-only file, the English
documentation lags very far behind the French documentation.
So, for the moment, you should learn French or wait for
the English documentation to catch up.
