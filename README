In general
----------

This package contains HP-48 and HP-50 programs to convert
Gregorian dates to French Revolutionary dates and in the other
direction. It includes also a reform which was never put in effect,
the decimalisation of time.

hpcalc.org
----------

Unzip the downloaded file and read calendrier.en.html
in a web browser. The installation instructions will
be found there.

github.org
----------

Unlike the package from hpcalc.org, you have only the base files,
from which the others are generated. The tool to generate 
the derived files can be found in another Git Hub repository.

https://github.com/jforget/perl-literate-prog-HP48-HP50

This tool must not be installed on the HP calculator,
but on a computer (PC or other). You need other software
on this computer: Graphviz, Perl and the Perl modules 
YAML.pl and GrapViz.pm.

http://www.perl.org/
http://search.cpan.org/dist/YAML/

When all this is installed, run the command

genere-hpweb calendrier

This generates several files including calendrier.en.html.
The end of the installation is explained in this file.
Read it in a web browser.
