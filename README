In general
----------

This package  contains HP-48 and  HP-50 programs to  convert Gregorian
dates to  French Revolutionary  dates and in  the other  direction. It
includes  also   a  reform  which   was  never  put  in   effect,  the
decimalisation of time.

These programs are copyright (c)  2011, Jean Forget. They are released

Unzip  the  downloaded  file  and  read calendrier.en.html  in  a  web
browser. The installation instructions will be found there.

github.org
----------

Unlike the package from hpcalc.org, you have only the base files, from
which the others are generated. The tool to generate the derived files
can be found in another Git Hub repository.

https://github.com/jforget/perl-literate-prog-HP48-HP50

This  tool must  not  be installed  on  the HP  calculator,  but on  a
computer  (PC or  other). You  need other  software on  this computer:
Graphviz, Perl and the Perl modules YAML.pl and GrapViz.pm.

http://www.graphviz.org/
http://www.perl.org/
http://search.cpan.org/dist/YAML/
http://search.cpan.org/dist/GraphViz/

When all this is installed, run the command

genere-hpweb calendrier

This generates several files including calendrier.en.html.  The end of
the installation is explained in this file.  Read it in a web browser.
